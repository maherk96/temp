How

Throughout 2025, I have continued to demonstrate ownership and accountability in my role as an SDET by driving improvements in test quality, governance, and automation standards across QA teams. I have led by example through detailed and consistent code reviews, ensuring that changes meet Sonar quality gates and align with our best practices — applying only those AI suggestions from GitHub that make practical sense for our context. By doing so, I’ve reinforced a culture of continuous improvement and helped engineers write cleaner, more maintainable code.

The QA automation framework to follows a fluent interface design, implementing a client → wait → verify pattern that is agnostic of the underlying system. This structure has become the foundation for most QA teams, enabling rapid test creation and improving readability, consistency, and scalability. The success of this approach was reflected when the OMS FIX API project was operational within just three days of development, demonstrating the maturity and usability of our framework.

Through this ownership-driven mindset, I have strengthened code quality across QA projects, reduced onboarding time for new engineers, and promoted sustainable engineering practices that ensure long-term maintainability and risk reduction.

I take pride in delivering solutions that uphold the highest standards of risk management and operational excellence. This year, the QA Portal has evolved significantly into a robust, auditable platform for test reporting and performance analytics. Teams now leverage trend analysis, regression heat maps, and performance metrics to gain visibility over testing coverage, release readiness, and baseline-to-release performance comparisons. These insights are reviewed weekly by teams such as Fusion Algo, helping them make data-driven go/no-go decisions and maintain confidence in production releases.

The QAP has also become a valuable tool for audit and compliance tracking. Our management and audit partners, including Scott’s team, can now easily verify when tests were last executed and assess coverage and readiness for production. By providing this transparency, QAP has improved traceability, accountability, and trust across teams.

In parallel, I continued developing mock services (COR, DSP, Credit Check) to minimise dependency on unstable UAT environments. The COR mock, now in final validation, has shown promising results from proof-of-concept testing and is positioned to replace the legacy LO mock. This initiative ensures alignment with our long-term strategy to improve environment reliability and reduce operational risk. The DSP mock, already adopted heavily by Fusion Algo, has proven invaluable in simulating complex trade scenarios, allowing QA teams to test challenging cases such as NDF pairs and market control logic in isolation.

Together, these initiatives strengthen Citi’s risk and control posture, enabling proactive risk mitigation and reinforcing platform resilience.

Collaboration and mentorship have remained key pillars of my contribution this year. I have worked closely with multiple QA engineers across teams — including Murat, Ahmed, Sasha, Sunil, Ben, Scott, Anirudh, and Wajid — providing one-to-one sessions on framework design, QAP features, and performance analytics. This has led to visible improvements in code quality and confidence among team members, as evidenced through PR reviews and independent feature delivery.

To foster broader team alignment, I’ve maintained and expanded our shared QA Utility Library, introducing new modules for middleware messaging (Solace, TIBRV), core FIX client functionality, CSV parsing, and fluent STOMP integration. These utilities simplify complex test logic, reduce duplication, and encourage consistent coding practices. The positive feedback and feature requests from other QA engineers highlight their growing adoption and value across projects.

The QAP’s adoption by OMS has further bridged cross-team collaboration, creating unified visibility into QA activities across multiple platforms. It provides a single view of testing trends and execution data accessible to all QA teams and management.

Through these combined efforts, I have helped cultivate a collaborative, high-performing QA culture — one that emphasises shared learning, consistent standards, and excellence in delivery. My work continues to focus on empowering teams, driving innovation, and ensuring our QA processes remain resilient, data-driven, and aligned with Citi’s commitment to operational and client excellence.


What

Risk & Control

This year, I continued to strengthen Citi’s Risk and Control framework by leading initiatives that enhanced test governance, audit-ability, and consistency across QA teams. Through the evolution of the QA Portal, we now provide auditable visibility into testing trends, regression execution, and performance metrics over time. The introduction of heat maps and baseline vs. release performance analytics has enabled teams to make informed release decisions and identify performance regressions proactively.

The rollout of mock services, including COR, DSP, and Credit Check, has significantly reduced dependencies on unstable UAT environments and improved the reliability of pre-production testing. The COR mock, now entering its final validation phase, is on track to replace the legacy LO mock, demonstrating its robustness and alignment with the firm’s strategy for environment simplification and control automation. These initiatives collectively reduced the operational risk associated with integration testing and enhanced our ability to identify issues early in the development lifecycle.

Additionally, by reinforcing QA governance through code quality leadership and enforcing design standards across automation frameworks, I’ve helped ensure that teams deliver maintainable, high-quality codebases. This has directly supported Citi’s control objectives by embedding risk awareness and consistency into our QA engineering practices.

Financial Performance

From a financial perspective, my focus on efficiency, reuse, and transparency has continued to deliver tangible cost savings and productivity improvements. The QAP’s performance analytics and reporting capabilities have empowered teams to reduce regression time, eliminate manual tracking, and make faster, data-informed release decisions. With the ongoing development of REST APIs for data access, QA Portal has become a central source of QA intelligence that supports performance monitoring and trend analysis across multiple systems.

The creation and enhancement of shared QA utility libraries have simplified automation and accelerated test delivery. Teams now rely on these reusable components — including messaging utilities, FIX client connectors, and CSV parsers — to quickly build tests without duplicating core logic. This standardisation has improved development velocity and significantly reduced maintenance overhead, aligning with Citi’s objective of achieving cost efficiency through automation and reuse.

The broader adoption of mock testing and in-house tools continues to reduce reliance on external systems and third-party solutions, directly supporting Citi’s financial empowerment and expense mitigation goals.

Client & Franchise Outcomes

In 2025, my efforts have focused on improving reliability, scalability, and collaboration across QA teams to ensure consistent, high-quality outcomes for our internal stakeholders. The adoption of QA Portal by multiple QA teams, has unified test reporting standards and provided cross-team visibility into QA activities and results. This transparency allows management to assess QA performance holistically and promotes a more coordinated, data-driven approach to quality assurance across the platform.

The DSP and Credit Check mock environments have enhanced client confidence by allowing for controlled, isolated testing of critical trading scenarios, minimising disruptions and ensuring that features meet functional and performance expectations before release. These solutions continue to strengthen the firm’s reputation for reliability and resilience.

Finally, by mentoring and upskilling QA engineers through one-to-one sessions, technical guidance, and collaborative reviews, I have helped elevate the overall capability of the QA function. Engineers now contribute with greater confidence, producing higher-quality code and adopting shared tools effectively. This collective growth has reinforced our culture of excellence, ownership, and teamwork, ensuring that Citi continues to deliver robust, reliable, and client-aligned solutions.
